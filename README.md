### This is the first Milestone Poroject for Springboard Full Stack Web Development Course.

### This project is based on the technologies covered so far and to demonstrate an understanding of them.

## Technologies Used...

+ HTML
+ CSS
+ Flexbox

## Objective..

+ The objective of this project is to highlight the achievements amd ambitions of this band called the Beatles,so I approached it from when they were first formed to the present day and the use of social media links.  
+ In doing this I used HTML,CSS and Flexbox to create a static website.I have tested it in it's various stages e.g to make sure the page links are working and the media quieries are all correct.
+ I used Flexbox to make the project fully responsive and tested this with various browsers and with Chrome Developer Tools.

## Outcome..
+ I have demonstrated here that I have a good knowledge of HTML,CSS and Flexbox and enough background to move on to the interactive module including Javascript and jQuery.

## User Experience (UX)
+ As this is a static website,it is just intended to be informative and visually appealing.The images,video and audio files are intended to inform the user as to who and what the band were/are.In the future I would like to expand the whole project with javascript,e.g an option to play a selected audio file on page load or to play the video on page load.I would like to add a mock shopping cart where the user has the option to be taken to an ecommerce page to buy various products,but as it is it is just a visual and audio representation.

## Acknologements..

+ All images on this project are from various third party image serving websites.
